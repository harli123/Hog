# Hog
1st Project - Dice game Hog - only file I actual changed was the "hog.py" file but have included all other files if you want full functionality of what is described in the project page:

http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp14/proj/hog/hog.html

Note: if you open the gui the default setting is you have 2 users play on the gui. If you want to play against my "final strategy" then execute "python hog_gui.py -f"
This is in python 3 as well
