# Hog
1st Project - Dice game Hog - only file I actual changed was the "hog.py" file but have included all other files if you want full functionality of what is described in the project page (except for autograder files as I'm working on learning how to use a local repository to easily upload files to this github)

Note: if you open the gui the default setting is you have 2 users play on the gui. If you want to play against my "final strategy" then execute "python hog_gui.py -f"
This is in python 3 as well
