# Hog
1st Project - Dice game Hog - only file I actual changed was the "hog.py" file but have included all other files if you want full functionality.

Code written by me sandwiched by comments that include the HLI comment, rest provided by template I was working off of.

Note: if you open the gui the default setting is you have 2 users play on the gui. If you want to play against my "final strategy" then execute "python hog_gui.py -f"
This is in python 3 as well
